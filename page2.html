            <p>The story of pizza is a rich and storied journey from its humble origins to becoming one of the most
                beloved and iconic foods worldwide:</p>

            <p>The concept of flatbreads with toppings can be traced back to ancient civilizations,
                including the Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans.
                These early versions of flatbreads with various toppings served as a precursor to what we now recognize
                as pizza.</p>
            </p>

            <p>The modern pizza we know today has its origins in Naples, Italy, in the 18th century.
                During this time, Naples was a crowded and bustling city with a thriving street food culture.
                The popular street food item known as "pizza" was a simple flatbread made with ingredients like
                tomatoes, olive oil, and local cheese.</p>
            <p>A significant milestone in the history of pizza is the creation of the Margherita pizza
                in 1889. The Queen of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, and her husband, King Umberto I, visited Naples. A
                local pizzaiolo, Raffaele Esposito, created a special pizza in her honour, topping it with tomatoes,
                mozzarella cheese, and basil to represent the colours of the Italian flag.
                This pizza became known as the Margherita pizza and is considered the classic Neapolitan pizza. </p>

            <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italian immigrants brought pizza to
                the United States, particularly in cities like New York and Chicago. It was initially considered an
                ethnic food but quickly gained popularity.</p>



            <p>As pizza spread around the world, it adapted to local tastes and ingredients.
                Different regions developed their own unique styles of pizza, such as the deep-dish pizza in Chicago,
                the thin and foldable New York slice, and the innovative California-style pizza with various toppings.</p>



             <p>In the mid-20th century, the concept of fast-food pizza and the rise of pizza
                chains like Domino's and Pizza Hut further popularised pizza as a convenient and accessible option.</p>



              <p>Today, pizza is one of the most widely recognized and enjoyed foods globally. It
                is available in countless variations, from traditional Italian to unique and inventive toppings,
                reflecting diverse culinary influences.</p>



                <p>The heritage of pizza showcases the fusion of culture, tradition, and innovation. From its humble
                beginnings in Naples to its global reach, pizza has become a symbol of comfort food and a culinary
                canvas for creativity, loved by people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>

            <h3>Pizza Recipe and Procedure</h3>
            <p>To make a classic Margherita pizza, begin with pizza dough. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the
                dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
                Sprinkle it with shredded mozzarella cheese and top with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with olive oil.
                Bake in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is crispy and the
                cheese is bubbly and golden.</p>
