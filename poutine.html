    <p class="food-paragraph">

         creating a mouthwatering combination of flavors and textures.</p>

            <p>Poutine's origins can be traced back to rural Quebec, Canada, in the late 1950s.
                 The word "poutine" is derived from the Quebecois slang term "pudding" or "mixture." 
            </p>

            <p> Poutine started as a humble and hearty dish made with three primary ingredients: french fries, cheese curds, and gravy.
                 The cheese curds are essential, and they must be fresh to maintain their characteristic squeaky texture. </p>
            </p>

            <p> Several stories exist about the invention of poutine, with various restaurants and diners claiming to be the birthplace.
                 However, it is commonly associated with a fast-food restaurant in rural Quebec called Le Roy Jucep. Some also credit Fernand Lachance as one of the earliest chefs to serve poutine.</p>

            <p>Poutine quickly gained popularity, particularly in Quebec, and was initially seen as a comfort food for working-class people.
                 It was affordable and satisfying, making it a staple in diners and greasy spoon establishments.</p>

            <p>Over the years, poutine has evolved and diversified. It's not just about the classic version; there are numerous variations that include toppings such as smoked meat, pulled pork, sausage, and even foie gras.
                 Some regions have put their own twists on the dish. 
            </p>

            <p>Poutine is celebrated as a quintessential Quebecois dish and a symbol of Canadian cuisine. It has grown to become a national comfort food and is enjoyed throughout Canada and in various international locations. 
            </p>

            <p> In Canada, poutine festivals have become popular events, where vendors and chefs showcase their creative takes on this iconic dish.
            </p>
            <p>The heritage of poutine reflects the inventive and satisfying nature of comfort food. What started as a simple combination of ingredients in rural Quebec has grown into a beloved and cherished dish that symbolises Canadian culinary culture. </p>

            <h3>Poutine and Procedure</h3>
            <p>To make poutine, start with crispy french fries. Sprinkle cheese curds over the hot fries, and then ladle piping hot beef gravy over the top.
             The heat of the gravy will melt the cheese curds, creating a delicious, savoury combination of flavours and textures.</p>
