    <p class="food-paragraph">
        Kimchi is a spicy and fermented Korean side dish made from vegetables, primarily napa cabbage and radishes,
        seasoned <br> with a mixture of chili pepper, garlic, ginger, and other flavorful ingredients.</p>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="left-section">
            <img width="830px" src="./images/kimchi-korea-kimchi-republic-of-korea-food.jpg">
            <p>The origins of kimchi can be traced back to ancient Korea. Early forms of kimchi involved preserving
                vegetables in salt,
                and this process was developed to ensure a year-round supply of vegetables in a country with distinct
                seasons.</p>

            <p>One of the key features of kimchi is its fermentation process. The lactic acid bacteria naturally present
                on vegetables ferment the sugars in the ingredients,
                creating a tangy and slightly sour flavour. This fermentation not only preserved the vegetables but also
                enhanced their nutritional value.</p>
            </p>

            <p>Kimchi can be made with various vegetables, but Napa cabbage and Korean radishes are the most common
                bases. The ingredients are combined with spices, garlic, ginger,
                and fish sauce or salted shrimp to create a flavorful and spicy brine.</p>

            <p>Kimchi has deep cultural significance in Korea and is considered a national dish. It is traditionally
                made in large batches, especially in the autumn, and families come together for this communal process.
                It's also a staple in Korean meals, often served as a side dish. Kimchi has played a vital role in
                Korean history. During times of war and famine, kimchi provided essential nutrients and sustenance.
                The tradition of making and consuming kimchi was passed down through generations.</p>

            <p> Different regions in Korea have their variations of kimchi, incorporating local ingredients and
                flavours. For example, Baechu kimchi (Napa cabbage kimchi) is the most popular variety,
                but there are also styles like kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi) and oisobagi (stuffed cucumber kimchi).
            </p>

            <p>Kimchi has gained international recognition and popularity due to its unique and bold flavours. It's not
                only a staple in Korean cuisine but has also been incorporated into various dishes and cuisines around
                the world. </p>

            <p>Kimchi-making continues to be a cherished tradition in Korean families, and it has even been recognized
                as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.
                There are festivals and events dedicated to kimchi, celebrating its cultural and culinary significance.
            </p>

            <p>The heritage of kimchi highlights its essential role in Korean culture and cuisine. Its enduring presence
                in Korean households, festivals, and daily meals underscores its significance in preserving and
                celebrating the country's culinary traditions. </p>

            <h3>Kimchi Recipe and Procedure</h3>
            <p>Traditional kimchi is made by salting and rinsing Napa cabbage, then coating it with a spicy paste made
                of garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, and sugar. Pack it tightly in a jar and let it ferment
                for several days to weeks at room temperature.
                The longer it ferments, the more complex the flavour becomes. </p>
