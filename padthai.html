    <h2 class="food-title">Savory Thai Noodle Delight: Pad Thai</h2>
    <p class="food-paragraph">
        Pad Thai is a delicious Thai stir-fried noodle dish that combines sweet, sour, and savory flavors, often garnished with <br> peanuts and fresh lime.</p>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="left-section">
            <img width="830px" src="./images/padthai.jpg">
            <p>The origins of Pad Thai can be traced back to the late 1930s or early 1940s in Thailand. At that time, Thailand's Prime Minister, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, sought to modernise and unify the country.
                 As part of his efforts, he aimed to promote Thai nationalism and culture, including its cuisine.</p>

            <p> Phibunsongkhram's government introduced a campaign to create a national dish that would showcase Thai ingredients and flavours. This initiative sought to distance Thailand from Chinese culinary influences.
                 Chinese-style noodle dishes were prevalent in Thailand, so the government aimed to develop a Thai alternative. </p>
            </p>

            <p> A government-sponsored cooking competition was organised to invent a new national dish. A chef named Luang Phibunsongkhram (or Thipsamai Pad Thai) is often credited with the creation of what is now known as Pad Thai.
                 He used rice noodles, which were more native to Thailand, and combined them with other traditional Thai ingredients such as shrimp, tofu, peanuts, lime, and tamarind sauce.</p>

            <p> Tamarind sauce plays a crucial role in Pad Thai's flavour. It provides the sweet, sour, and slightly tangy taste that distinguishes the dish.
                 Tamarind was chosen as an essential ingredient, representing Thailand's flavours and heritage.</p>

            <p>Pad Thai quickly gained popularity and became a beloved street food dish. It was not only tasty but also affordable, making it accessible to a wide range of people. 
            </p>

            <p>Over time, Pad Thai became famous beyond Thailand's borders. As Thai cuisine gained popularity internationally, Pad Thai was embraced worldwide and became a symbol of Thai food. 
                In different regions, you may find various versions of Pad Thai, with the addition of different proteins or vegetables. Vegetarian and vegan versions are also common.
               Pad Thai has evolved to suit different tastes while maintaining its unique balance of flavours. 
            </p>

            <p>The heritage of Pad Thai is a testament to the creative culinary adaptation and the role of food in shaping cultural identity.
                 It was developed to reflect Thailand's heritage and became an iconic dish that showcases the country's diverse and harmonious flavours.
