    <p class="food-paragraph">
        Churros are a popular Spanish dessert known for their deep-fried, crispy exterior and soft, doughy interior,
        often enjoyed <br> with a dusting of sugar and a side of rich, velvety chocolate sauce for dipping.</p>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="left-section">
            <img width="830px" src="./images/churros.jpg">
            <p>The history of churros dates back to the Iberian Peninsula, where it was influenced by the Moorish
                occupation of Spain. The Moors brought with them new culinary techniques, including frying dough.
                The name "churro" may have derived from the Arabic word "suriyya" or "zalabia," which referred to fried
                pastries.</p>

            <p> Over time, churros evolved in Spain, particularly in the region of Andalusia.
                Spanish shepherds and travellers in the countryside began making a simple dough from flour, water, and
                salt.
                They would fry it in a pan over an open fire, resulting in a snack that was easy to prepare and
                transport.
                Chinese-style noodle dishes were prevalent in Thailand, so the government aimed to develop a Thai
                alternative. </p>
            </p>

            <p> Churros made their way to Latin America through Spanish explorers and settlers.
                The churro recipe was adapted and evolved in various countries, becoming a beloved treat in Mexico,
                where it's often served with a rich, hot chocolate for dipping. </p>

            <p>Churros also gained popularity in other European countries, with variations like the Portuguese "massa
                tenra" and the French "choux pastry." These pastries are related to churros and share a similar frying
                technique.</p>

            <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, churros underwent further adaptations. The dough was sweetened, and
                churros began to be coated in sugar, which is a common feature of the churros we know today.
            </p>

            <p>Churros became associated with street food culture, often sold by street vendors or at fairs and
                festivals. Churro stands are common sights in many Spanish-speaking countries.
            </p>

            <p>Churros have gained international recognition and can be found in various forms and adaptations
                worldwide, often served with a variety of dips and toppings, including chocolate sauce, caramel, or
                cinnamon sugar.
            </p>
            <p>The heritage of churros is a story of culinary exchange and adaptation. From its Moorish origins in Spain
                to its spread throughout Latin America and beyond,
                churros have become a beloved treat with a deliciously crispy exterior and soft interior, enjoyed by
                people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>
