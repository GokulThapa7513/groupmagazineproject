    <p class="food-paragraph">Moussaka is a classic Greek dish featuring layers of eggplant, ground meat,
        and a rich tomato-based sauce, topped with <br> a creamy béchamel sauce, then baked to perfection.</p>

            <p>The story of moussaka is a journey that begins in the Middle East but has strong ties to Greece and other
                Mediterranean countries:</p>

            <p>The origins of moussaka can be traced back to the Middle East. The word "moussaka" is believed to have
                been derived from the Arabic term "musaqqa'a," which means "chilled."
                Early versions of the dish in the Middle East were typically a cold or room temperature eggplant and
                meat casserole. </p>
            </p>

            <p>While the concept of moussaka had been present in the Middle East for centuries, the dish underwent
                significant changes when it was adopted in Greece.
                Greek moussaka, as it is known today, is traditionally made with layers of eggplant (aubergine) and
                minced meat,
                usually lamb or beef, topped with a creamy béchamel sauce. </p>

            <p>The inclusion of béchamel sauce in Greek moussaka is a distinguishing feature. It adds a rich and creamy
                layer to the dish,
                setting it apart from the original Middle Eastern versions. </p>

            <p> Greek moussaka is prepared by layering slices of eggplant with the meat and tomato sauce.
                The dish is baked until it forms a golden-brown crust on top. It is typically served warm and is enjoyed
                as a comforting and hearty meal.</p>

            <p>Moussaka holds a special place in Greek cuisine and culture. It is often regarded as a national dish and
                is enjoyed on various occasions and celebrations.
                While the traditional Greek moussaka with eggplant is the most well-known version, there are variations
                that use zucchini or potatoes instead of eggplant.
                Vegetarian moussaka is also popular, replacing the meat with lentils or chickpeas. </p>

            <p>Moussaka's appeal extends beyond Greece. It is widely enjoyed throughout the Mediterranean region,
                including Cyprus and the Balkans.
                In some countries, it has become a popular dish in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurants
                worldwide. </p>

            <p>The heritage of moussaka showcases the way culinary traditions evolve and adapt as they travel across
                borders and cultures.
                It's a dish that has strong ties to Greek cuisine and is celebrated for its rich flavours and
                comforting, layered casserole structure. </p>

                <p>The heritage of pizza showcases the fusion of culture, tradition, and innovation. From its humble
                beginnings in Naples to its global reach, pizza has become a symbol of comfort food and a culinary
                canvas for creativity, loved by people of all ages and backgrounds. </p>
