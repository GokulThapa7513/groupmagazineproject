    <h2 class="food-title">Hungarian Goulash: Hearty Comfort Dish</h2>
    <p class="food-paragraph">
        Goulash is a rich and flavorful Hungarian stew traditionally made with tender chunks of beef, paprika,
         and a medley of vegetables, making it a comforting and satisfying dish.</p>
    <div class="content-container">
        <div class="left-section">
            <img width="830px" src="./images/goulash.jpeg">
            <p>The roots of goulash can be traced back to mediaeval Hungary. The word "goulash" is believed to have originated from the Hungarian term "gulyás," which means "herdsman."
                 Gulyás referred to the Hungarian cattle herders, who would prepare a one-pot meal of meat, vegetables, and spices in a cauldron over an open flame while out tending to their herds. 
            </p>

            <p>  Over time, the dish evolved from a simple, rustic meal to a more sophisticated and flavorful stew. 
                Various ingredients were added to the original recipe, including paprika, a spice that would become a defining characteristic of Hungarian goulash. </p>
            </p>

            <p> The use of paprika in goulash became more widespread in the 18th century, thanks to Hungarian nobility and chefs who embraced the rich and earthy flavor that paprika added to the dish.
                 The variety of paprika known as "noble sweet" became the preferred choice. </p>

            <p>Goulash recipes can vary across regions of Hungary and other countries in Central Europe. For example, "pörkölt" is a stew with similar ingredients but prepared without the broth or liquid that is used in goulash.
                 Another variation is "halászlé," a fisherman's soup with paprika that is beloved in Hungary. </p>

            <p>Goulash has become a symbol of Hungarian cuisine and culture. It's often associated with warmth, comfort, and hospitality in Hungary. The dish has also become a popular choice in many Central European countries.
            </p>

            <p>Goulash has not remained limited to its Hungarian origins. It has been embraced around the world and is often found on the menus of Hungarian and Central European restaurants globally. 
            </p>

            <p>The heritage of goulash celebrates the enduring appeal of a dish that started as a practical and hearty meal for cattle herders but evolved into a cherished national treasure, celebrated for its rich and satisfying flavours.

            <h3>Goulash and Procedure</h3>
            <p>For a hearty goulash, simmer chunks of beef with onions, paprika, caraway seeds, and a touch of tomato paste until the meat is tender and the sauce is rich and flavorful. Serve it traditionally with boiled or mashed potatoes or egg noodles. </p>
